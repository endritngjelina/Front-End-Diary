# Front-End Diary – Multi-Version Web App

This project includes several versions of a front-end diary-style application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

Each version is its own standalone file, where I experimented with different layouts, styling, and features like formatting entries or adding dynamic effects. This was a hands-on way for me to grow my front-end skills and explore how to build lightweight, personal web apps.

### 📁 Versions

- `diary 0.html` – Basic structure with initial layout
- `diary 1.html` – Slightly improved styling
- `diary 2.html` – Enhanced readability and spacing
- `diary 3.html` – Experimental version with new colors/fonts
- `diary 4.html` – Refined version with cleaner layout and more interaction

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML** – for content and structure  
- **CSS** – for layout, typography, and design  
- **JavaScript** – for any dynamic behavior or user interactivity

### 💡 Why I Built This

This was a creative way for me to:

- Practice front-end fundamentals
- Work on personal productivity app concepts
- Try out different visual styles and layouts
- Learn how to improve a project over multiple iterations
